        <p>Thank you for visiting my website. Just like any other website, you've just reached the about section where most website owners take the chance to introduce themselves.</p></br>
        <p>My full name is Francis Engcoy Gelsano. I was born in Iligan City but raised and grew up in Matalom, Leyte. I have completed my college degree from a local school in Hilongos, Leyte called MLG College of Learning, Inc.</p></br>
        <p>I never thought I would get myself into the world of programming. As a kid, I always dreampt about becoming an airline pilot. To me, being a pilot means you can travel to distant places in just few hours. You can even go to different places in just one day - if, you are a PILOT.</p></br>
        <p>Why am I not a pilot? It's because of a sad truth. Just like any other frustrated pilot-wannabees out there, training to become a pilot requires a lot of money and that's what me &amp; my family don't have. I am a son of a not-so financially abled parents. Nevertheless, that won't stop me from becoming successful. I may not be a pilot but I will make sure that I am someone else. Someone who didn't surrender and someone who struggled to fight poverty. (HAHA, drama.)</p></br>
        <p>Let's go back to why I'm a web developer.</p> </br>
        <p>After I graduated high school, my parents couldn't send me to college due to financial reasons. So just to get into college, I grabbed any possible scholarship I could get. I happen to get a course related to computer and not just any computer-related course. It's a computer programming course. That's how I found out about my skills and passion towards programming.</p>
        <p>That's how everything started and the rest is history...</p></br>
